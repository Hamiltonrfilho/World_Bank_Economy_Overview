## Introduction

This project aims to provide an interactive dashboard built in Tableau using The world bank data. The dashboard presents a comprehensive overview of economic indicators from all countries in the databank from 1991 to 2021. Users can use the map as a filter to visually select the data they want to see or use the built-in search function on the map to write the country name.

Feel free to explore the [dashboard on Tableau Public]([https://link-to-your-tableau-public-dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hamilton.roth.filho/viz/WorldEconomyOverviewTheworldbankdata/Dashboard1)). Feed back is always appreciated.

## Indicators provided

- **GDP growth:** Measures the percentage change in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over a year, indicating the rate of economic expansion or contraction.
- **Economic sectors:** Shows the percentage contribution of different sectors to the overall GDP, highlighting the sectoral composition of the economy.
- **Account Balance:** Indicates the percentage relationship between a country's total exports and imports, reflecting the balance between foreign trade earnings and expenditures.
- **Inflation:** Represents the percentage increase in the average price level of goods and services over a year, reflecting changes in purchasing power.
- **Unemployment:**  Measures the percentage of the labor force that is jobless and actively seeking employment, providing insights into the extent of joblessness in the economy.
- **Debt to GDP:** Represents the percentage of a country's total debt owed by the central government in relation to the GDP, indicating the government's borrowing burden.
## Data

The dashboard utilizes data from [DataBank | World Development Indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators). The dataset contains is composed by a few Series from 1991 to 2021 for 217 Countries (Or what is considered/recognized as country by the DataBank).

## Issues and Challenges

During the development of this project, a few challenges were encountered:

- **Missing data:**  The dashboard reveals occasional gaps in the data for different indicators, indicating missing values or incomplete records. These gaps should be taken into account when interpreting the results and drawing conclusions.
- **Inconsistency:** In the Economic sectors chart, there are instances where the total percentage exceeds 100% for certain countries and years. This inconsistency might be attributed to variations in data collection methodologies or classification systems across different sources.
- **Reliability:** It is important to consider the reliability of the economic data presented in the dashboard. Since some of the data represents national estimates, verifying the accuracy and veracity of some values can be challenging.

I appreciate any feedback or suggestions to improve the dashboard and enhance its usability.
